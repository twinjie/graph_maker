For Graph Maker

	If resource node selected, give option to update resource count
		instead of needing to select button.

	Needed: 

		Option to clear clear all nodes/connections

		Option for what to include in the output file
			i.e.	num processes,
					num resources,
					existing resources vector,
					possessed resource vector,
					available resources vector,
					Currently assigned matrix,
					Unmet needs matrix,
					Maximum claim matrix


		Drag nodes & redraw any connections at the new position.
			ORRR, while a node is being dragged, the connection can continuously
			redraw to give appearance that it is moving with the node. 
				If node crosses center point of from node, then assign to opposite edge?


		Give feedback for if it's a:
			cycle:
			knot:
			Toggle for expedient? (automatically have request arrows redraw)
			sink count / node(s)?
			any other relevent information
			Deadlock?
